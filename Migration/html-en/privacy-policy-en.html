            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">Foreigners Lublin cares about your privacy, so we have developed a Policy that governs the collection, use, disclosure, transfer and storage of users' personal information. When working, Foreigners Lublin may be guided by these rules, the Law of Ukraine on "Personal Data Protection", as well as Agreements with our clients.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy__subtitle subtitle _anim-items">Collection and use of personal information</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">Personal information is data that can be used to identify a person or to contact him.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">Whenever you contact Foreigners Lublin or a partner or agent of Foreigners Lublin, you may be asked to provide personal information.

            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">When we use your information for anti-fraud purposes, it is driven by online transactions through our systems. We limit the use of data for anti-fraud purposes only for those purposes that are strictly necessary and affect our legitimate interests in connection with the protection of customers and services. For certain online transactions, we may also verify the information you provide using publicly available information sources.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We may use your personal information, including date of birth, passport number, full name, citizenship and other information, to verify your identity, identify the user and select the services that are suitable for you.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">From time to time, we use the collected personal information to send you important notices, such as messages about services and changes to terms and policies. You cannot opt out of receiving such messages, as this information is necessary to interact with Foreigners Lublin.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We may use personal information for internal purposes, such as conducting audits, data analysis and research to improve Foreigners Lublin products and services, and how we communicate with customers.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy__subtitle subtitle _anim-items">Sources of personal information when we do not receive it from you</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We may receive your personal information from other people if they have provided it to us in connection with the provision of a service by Foreigners Lublin. For security and fraud prevention purposes, we may also verify the information you provide to provide services with the involvement of a third party.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy__subtitle subtitle _anim-items">Collection and use of non-personal information</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We also collect data that is not directly related to a specific person. We may collect, use, transfer and disclose such information for any purpose. Here are some examples of what non-personal information we collect and use.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We may collect information such as place of work, language, zip code, area code, unique device identifier, link source URL, location and time zone in which the Foreigners Lublin product is used. This helps us to better understand the needs of our users and to offer them better products, services and advertising.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We may collect information about the actions of customers on our website, social networks, sites and services of our partners and agents. In addition, we may use data obtained from our other products and services. This information allows us to provide customers with more useful information, as well as understand which sections of the website, products and services are of increased interest. The data compiled under this privacy policy does not belong to the category of personal information.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We may collect and store information about how you use our services, including search queries. This information can be used to improve the relevance of the services we provide. Such information may be associated with your IP address.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy__subtitle subtitle _anim-items">Disclosure of information to third parties</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">Occasionally, Foreigners Lublin may share certain personal information with third parties to provide or improve its products and services, including to provide products at your request or to promote Foreigners Lublin products on the market faster. In such cases, we require these third parties to process this information in accordance with applicable law. Foreigners Lublin does not sell personal information and personal information is not shared with third parties for marketing purposes.</p>
            <h3 class="privacy-policy__subtitle subtitle _anim-items">Your privacy rights</h3>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">You can help us ensure that your contact information is accurate, complete and up-to-date by providing additional information to our specialists. With regard to all other personal data, we will provide you with access to it, including a copy of it, including if you want to correct errors in the information or ask to erase it - we will comply with such a request if Foreigners Lublin is not obliged to store the data legally, or she does not need them for legitimate business transactions.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">We may refuse to execute requests that are unfounded or in bad faith, violate the privacy of other users, do not make sense, or which are not required by local law to access. We may also reject aspects of erasure or access requests if we believe that doing so would question our legitimate anti-fraud and security uses of the data, as described above.</p>
            <p class="privacy-policy__text text _anim-items">Foreigners Lublin will periodically update this Privacy Policy. In the event of material changes to this Policy, an updated Policy will be posted on our website.
